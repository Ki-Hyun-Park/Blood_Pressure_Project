# Islands_Project

For this project, I worked with 4 group members and we spent about a week to finish the whole anaylsis.


Overall, we:

Conducted a 2x2 factorial model with blocking(age/gender) and analyzed the effects of two factors(exercise/diets) on blood pressure.

Used the website called “The Islands”(website with virtual islands that have information on inhabitant’s diet, exercise routine, health, age, and gender) and collected every data on 48 inhabitants.   

Used google spreadsheeet to 1)construct structure of design(2x2 factorial with 2 blocks) and 2)data table for both factors and blocks.

Divided age block into 3 levels(16-35, 36-55, 56+) and gender block into 2 levels(males/females). Also represented these levels with (-1,0,1) in R.

Generated ANOVAs/ Residuals Plot/ Normality Plot/ Interaction Plot and produced several kinds of insights on the relationship between blood pressure and exercise/diets.
