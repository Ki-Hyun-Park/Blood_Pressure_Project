# Blood Pressure Project

***

- <p> The whole project was done in about 2 weeks and it was conducted by group of 7 people. </p>

- As a group of 7 people, we:

<p> - Conducted a 2x2 factorial model with blocking(age/gender) and analyzed the effects of two factors(exercise/diets) on blood pressure. </p>

<p> - Used the website called “The Islands”(website with virtual islands that have information on inhabitant’s diet, exercise routine, health, age, and gender) and collected every data on 48 inhabitants. </p>

<p> - Used google spreadsheeet to 1)construct structure of design(2x2 factorial with 2 blocks) and 2)data table for both factors and blocks. </p>

<p> - Divided age block into 3 levels(16-35, 36-55, 56+) and gender block into 2 levels(males/females). Also represented these levels with (-1,0,1) in R. </p>

<p> - Generated ANOVAs/ Residuals Plot/ Normality Plot/ Interaction Plot and produced several kinds of insights on the relationship between blood pressure and exercise/diets. </p>
