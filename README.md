# Islands_Project

Conducted a full 2x2 factorial model with blocking and analyzed the effects of two factors(exercise/diets) on blood pressure.

Logged into the website called “The Islands”(website with virtual islands that have information on inhabitant’s diet, exercise routine, health, age, and gender) and collected every data on 48 inhabitants.   

Used Excel and created the data table with variables(factors of inhabitants).

Divided age block into 3 levels(16-35, 36-55, 56+) and gender block into 2 levels(males/females). Also represented these levels with (-1,0,1) in R.

Generated ANOVAs/ Residuals Plot/ Normality Plot/ Interaction Plot and produced several kinds of insights on the relationship between blood pressure and exercise/diets.
